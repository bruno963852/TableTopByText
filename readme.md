## Usage
The bot responds to user commands on text channels. You can:

* Roll dice
* Create a Scenario
* Add Tokens on the Scenario
* Move Tokens

### Scenario
A Scenario is basically a game map. The bot creates one independent scenario for each text channel that invokes the command. On the same text channel, every time a new scenario is created (or loaded), the old one is overwritten.

### Commands
To invoke a bot command, just use one of the prefixes bellow:
* !dtre.
* ?dtre.
* !r.
* ?r.
